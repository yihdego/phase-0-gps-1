*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I struggled with the pulling the repository into my local system, in this session I struggled in understanding whose repository I am uploading to or downloading from.

*What Concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I understood the pull command and the push command clearly.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about the url links for the fetch command to my pair and we did some research on it. To the guide I asked about the additional sources we could get for the git and github usage.

*What still confuses you about Git?
I am still completely lost on the usage of fetch command.

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was amazing my pair was very supportive and the guide gave good insights and helped us when we got stuck, we took longer than the hour mark so our guide left and we stayed back and completed the work together.
